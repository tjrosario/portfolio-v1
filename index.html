When I first met him, I thought knew a lot. It turned out I knew about 30% of what I thought I did. Now, almost 6 years later, I still turn to Tom when I need that "I only know ONE guy who can solve this one" perspective. Tom is a true gem in the field of front-end technology and I owe a good portion of my skill-set to him.</span>

He is familiar with CSS fundamentals and also keeps up with everything that is cutting edge. He has pioneered prototypes involving responsive design, LESS, and SAS. His expertise in HTML/CSS is only surpassed by his skills in javascript. He is THE javascript resource at our company and can handle anything from basic effects, to complex parallax animations, to large scale JS applications. Tom also has built up and manages a great team of front-end engineers. He has great management qualities and I would put complete trust in him running a project or a team.</span>

As a PM, I've found Tom to be especially conducive to my work because he is consistently on or ahead of his deadlines and extremely accommodating when plans change. Tom is a great guy, and I hope our future projects intersect as often as possible.</span>
